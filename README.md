# Mercadoni Node Challenge

The Mercadoni Node Challenge is a small excercise to asses your coding skills,
whether you have used Node or not.

## The Challenge

Attached you will find plain file with addresses in Bogot√°. The 
objective is to make a JS script/module/app that:
  
  - Reads the file
  - Query the (Google Geocoding API)[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start]
    for the addresses coordinates
  - Write a plain CSV file with three columns: the addresses, latitudes and
    longitudes

Please, feel free to add comments to explain particular parts of the code that
you think should be highlighted or explained, or where you feel you had to make
a code design decision that you find interesting or relevant.

Good luck!
